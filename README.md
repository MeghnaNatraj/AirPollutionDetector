# Air Pollution Detector

An Embedded Systems created with the objective to keep a track of the amount of pollution in the air by using the  sensors like CO (Carbon Monoxide) sensor and Sn02 (Tin Dioxide) and monitor air pollution. 

The objective of the project is to keep a track of the amount of pollution in the air by using the  sensors like CO (Carbon Monoxide) sensor and Sn02 (Tin Dioxide) .When the percentage level of one or both these gases crosses a certain threshold level then the sensors detect it and send appropriate signals to microprocessor . The micro controller interprets these signals and displays a message on the LCD screen . Also the appropriate LED for the gas sensor which has sent the signal is lit up and a buzzer is used to indicate that there is pollution in the surrounding environment.

As the amount of pollution has increased tremendously in the past few years,measures must be taken to control and monitor the amount of toxic gases emitted by industries as these gases adversely affect the environment and the livelihood of wildlife and human beings. As Sn02 and CO are the most toxic of gases released by industries , this detector can be used to monitor the level of these gases emitted by the exhaust pipes in the industries. 

## Components Used 

1. Sn02 (Tin Dioxide)  Gas Sensor
2. CO (Carbon Monoxide) Gas Sensor
3. 8051 Microcontoller Circuit Board
4. 8051 Microcontoller : AT89C51 (by Atmel)
5. 16 * 2 LCD Display
6. Buzzer
7. Two LEDs

## Features of the gas detectors

* Good sensitivity to the Harmful gases in wide range 
* Long life and low cost
* Simple drive circuit

Hence the entire project is also compact and portable and has hence has numerous other applications ,i.e, it can used as a Domestic air pollution detector or as a Portable air pollution detector.

## Softwares Used

* Kiel uVision4 : For writing and compiling code.
* Flash Magic: To burn the hex file into the micro controller.
